bigbadselect
============

A jQuery plugin for creating minimalistic custom select(s). It doesn't modify
anything about a `select` besides adding an html layer on top which can
be easily styled. Also works inline inside a `form`. So you do not need
to change anything to your current structure. Also supports custom
templates for an `option` and the currently selected `option`.
